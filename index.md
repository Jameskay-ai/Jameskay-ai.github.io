## About Me

  I'm Jimmy — a seasoned cloud consultant with a strong foundation in GCP, AWS, and infrastructure management. Lately, I’ve been expanding my skill set into AI, Python, and intelligent automation — learning through hands-on projects and real-world experimentation.

While I'm still growing in Python development, I’m committed to building practical tools that combine my cloud experience with emerging AI technologies.

I’m focused on:
### 🔹 Gaining hands-on experience by building real-world AI tools
### 🔹 Applying my cloud expertise to create scalable, cost-effective systems
### 🔹 Deepening my Python skills through consistent learning and practice
### 🔹 Staying grounded, adaptable, and open to mentorship and growth
